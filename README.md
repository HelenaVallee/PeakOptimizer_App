# PeakOptimizer  
**AI-Powered Cognitive & Physical Resilience for Peak Performance**  

## 🔥 Overview  
PeakOptimizer is an **AI-powered productivity and well-being system** that enhances focus, prevents burnout, and counteracts the **hidden physical and cognitive damage** caused by prolonged desk work.  

By merging **productivity tech with health tech**, PeakOptimizer ensures sustained peak performance by delivering **real-time micro-interventions** based on user behavior.  

## 🚀 Key Features (MVP)  
✅ **Work Pattern Tracking** – Detects extended focus periods and lack of breaks.  
✅ **Physical Reset Triggers** – AI prompts a **60-second posture fix/stretch** when needed.  
✅ **Minimal Notifications** – Only nudges the user at key moments to prevent disruption.  

## 📊 Data Processed by the AI  
PeakOptimizer analyzes real-time **work behavior, cognitive engagement, and physical strain**, including:  
- **Work session intensity** (detects long periods without breaks).  
- **Typing & mouse activity rhythms** (assesses focus and cognitive fatigue).  
- **Application & screen usage** (detects deep work vs. distractions).  
- **User response patterns** (adapts interventions based on personal needs).  
- **(Future Expansion) Spinal & musculoskeletal stress indicators** (via webcam posture tracking or optional wearable integration).  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)  
- **AI Engine:** OpenAI API (for future advanced adaptation)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Planned for later versions)  
- **Data Processing:** NumPy, Pandas (for tracking user behavior)  

## 🎯 Future Roadmap  
✔ **Phase 1 (MVP - Now):** Work tracking + Physical Reset Triggers.  
✔ **Phase 2:** AI learns user habits + Adaptive break scheduling.  
✔ **Phase 3:** Integration with wearables & real-time posture tracking.
